Gaia is the server side component of Projects4Me. It manages the data, exposes the REST API and performs the maintenance
tasks on the application. 

Gaia is created keeping performance in mind. In order to minimize the memory and CPU footprint it is created on top
of PhalconPHP. The decision to build the platform on top of PhalconPHP was not for performance sake alone, in the later
phases on the application customization options will be introduced. This change will require the application to be
built on a very modular approach making most of the application extensible. Since PhalconPHP is extremely modular in its
design, more so than most of the other frameworks, it was the best choice to build the application in.
